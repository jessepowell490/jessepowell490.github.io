        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
          <p>The Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, also known as the 520 Bridge and officially the Governor Albert D. Rosellini Bridge, carries Washington State Route 520 across Lake Washington from Seattle to its eastern suburbs. The 7,710-foot-long (2,350 m) floating span is the longest floating bridge in the world, as well as the world's widest measuring 116 feet (35 m) at its midpoint.The bridge opened in April 2016 and replaced another floating bridge of the same name at the site, which was 130 feet (40 m) shorter.</p>

        <h3>Latest Update</h3>
          <p>The new bridge was dedicated on April 2, 2016, in a ceremony presided over by Governor of Washington Jay Inslee. The ceremony also included a community marathon and walk on the bridge, and a bicycle ride hosted by the Cascade Bicycle Club on the bridge and the Interstate 5 express lanes the following day.[35] As part of the opening ceremonies, the bridge was certified as the world's longest floating bridge by Guinness World Records, at 7,708.49 feet (2,349.55 m) long;[36] the bridge took the record from the previous Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, which is 130 feet (40 m) shorter in length. Traffic on the new bridge was shifted over in two stages, beginning with westbound traffic on April 11 and ending with eastbound traffic on April 25.[38][39] Initially, the bridge will narrow from 6 lanes to 4 lanes at the end of the floating span, over 1.2 miles (1.9 km) east of the Montlake Boulevard interchange, and not be fully traversable for bicyclists and pedestrians; the new westbound approach bridge is scheduled to be open in the summer of 2017. Shortly after the opening of the bridge's westbound lanes, the Washington State Transportation Commission proposed increasing toll rates to introduce nighttime tolling by 2017. The old bridge was planned to be decommissioned by floating away pontoons to an industrial site in Kenmore for disposal and recycling;[43] in March 2016, the city rejected the plan, citing the possible release of toxins in the pontoon's concrete.[44] The pontoons were sold to a recycling company based in Gig Harbor which plans to reuse the individual pontoons for floating decks and other projects.[45] An unaffiliated contest was held in 2012 seeking ideas for the 33 pontoons of the old bridge, with solutions ranging from a "floating High Line" to partial submersion for walking paths.</p>
